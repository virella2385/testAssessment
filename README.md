# testAssessment

This is a javascript class containing two functions. One function, 
`aboveBelow`, takes two arguments, a number list and a comparison value. 
This returns an object with an above and below count after comparing to the 
provided value.

The 2nd function, `stringRotation`, also takes two arguments, a string and 
a number that counts how many characters from the end of the string will be 
prepended to said string. This function returns the new string.
